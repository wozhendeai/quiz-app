# Project 2: Quiz App

## Project Introduction

In this project you and your team will be creating a quiz application. This application utilizes the client-server architecture. The server will be in charge of deciding which questions to include, when the game starts, keeping track of the score and serving the html/css/js files.
Each group, should maintain and submit a README.md file. In this file you should include all the features you and your team have developed, how to run the server, the name of participating team members, and what each team members role was in the development of the quiz app.
Use of ChatGPT, Google, Stack Overflow are allowed, however if I were to ask on how you implemented a feature, you should possess full knowledge of the code and how it works. Otherwise, a lower/failing grade will be given.


## Project Specs
### Main Features:

	1. The home page where the user will be able to start the quiz.
	2. The quiz page where the user will be able to play the 10-question quiz.
	3. The results page where the user will be able to see what they scored in the quiz.

Additionally, you will need to incorporate:

	1. A signup/login page for the user to create an account.
	2. Save users score along with other user information into MongoDB.
	3. Create a user profile page where the user can see their play history.
	4. Create a leaderboard page where users can see the top-10 players and how they rank compared to them

### Extra Features (Optional):

	1. A timer for the quiz or for each question.
	2. Ability to choose how many questions the quiz will have.
	3. Ability to replay/restart.

## Quiz Questions
### Early Phase:
In the same location as this memo, you will find a zip file of questions-answer zip file with a json file inside. The json includes a series of questions, answers, and correct answer. The way you choose which questions to display is up to you. But if a user plays twice, they should not be getting the same set of questions (although one or two may repeat).

### Later Phase:
Replace the hard-coded questions with the API call. You will utilize the Trivia API (free): https://opentdb.com/api_config.php for your questions, the number of questions and the question category.


## Deployment
You are required to deploy/host your app on the internet. There are many hosting services out there, but in any case do NOT enter any card/payment details, there is not need for that. These hosting services provide free tier subscriptions for small projects like ours. Examples of hosting services are: Render or Heroku.


## Submission
You will submit the link of your leader's Github account, where I will be able to see the full code and contributions. Also, you need to submit the quiz app url for me visit your hosted project. All in all, you submission will be comprised of 2 urls: GitHub and Quiz App.
